            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As of writing this, I am sitting in Web Page Development my Junior year of High School. I took Web Page freshman year but never got college credit for it so I have to retake it Junior year. Due to me relearning this knowledge, I decided to share. Other than that, I played around 10 years of Baseball, and I've played (so far) about 5 years of Golf. I've always enjoyed computer science, whether I'm coding using Python to make a calculator using the Quadratic Formula or learning mcFunction to make the most random Minecraft datapacks.</p>

        <div class="whyMade" hidden>
            <h2>Why this was Made</h2>
            <p>This was made for 2 reasons, one as a gift for anyone that it finds, and two, as a reminder for future me on how to make a list item. I hope this can aid whoever that this finds, I will admit, this is the first thing I'm writing on this page so even I don't know what to find within these pages. But I will say my goal is to teach whoever reads this the basics to HTML, CSS, and jQuery(not Javascript, it's basically jQuery but harder).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="whereTo" hidden>
            <h2>Where to?</h2>
            <p>That is a good question, below there are going to be some instructions help and friendly reminders, make sure to keep a keen eye for their may be secrets hidden <img src="img/Red.webp" id="red" class="popup" hidden><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/" id="sus">among</a>st the code. I'd recommend starting your journey in the HTML pages(assuming that's how I structure these pages). Enjoy your journey young one and good luck on your adventures.</p>
