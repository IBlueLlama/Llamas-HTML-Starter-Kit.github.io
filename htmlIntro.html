   <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
   <p>HTML is the skeleton of your webpage, it will be where you type the most important information that will make up the webpage that you create. Without HTML your webpage would never be able to take shape, just like if I took your bones you would be all meat and no bones... Anyways as I was saying, HTML holds all of the most important information, it will hold your paragraphs of text, the images and links you use. It will also contain the information the browser will need, like the lanugage or the document type.</p>
   <h3>Notes Prior to Starting</h3>
   <p>A common joke in the coding fields is, "Don't reinvent the wheel", I have no idea where this came from but it definetly is something to note. In HTML, CSS, and jQuery, there is a lot of repetition, so for a future note, I'd recommend making a template for yourself that you may use later on(Index.html actually uses my own template and the first 3 intro pages are direct copies of index.html). If I remember to link my template, I will, odds are I will forget :/</p>
   <h3>Getting Started</h3>
   <p>There are many different tags in HTML, and I mean a LOT! But they are all pretty straight forward and simply require a small amount of memorization.</p>
   <h3>How do the Tags work?</h3>
   <p>In theory, it is simple. You open that tag with whatever then close it shortly after. For example, you would open a paragraph tag with < p > then you would type whatever you want, then you would close the tag with < /p ></p>
   <p>< p > This is an example < /p ></p>
   <ul>
    <!-- H1-H6 Information -->
    <li><h4>< h1 ></h4><p>This is a header tag, it can range from h1 to h6. The larger the number, the small the font size(h1 being the largest, and h6 being the smallest). This is typically used for titles.</p></li>
    <li><h4>< p ></h4><p>This is a paragraph tag, it is used to store generic text that would span, well, paragraphs.</p></li>
    <li><h4></h4></li>
   </ul>
